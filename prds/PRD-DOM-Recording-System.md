# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## DOM Interaction Recording and Replay System

### 1. Executive Summary

**Product Vision**: Build a comprehensive system that captures user interactions on websites and replays them automatically, enabling automated testing, user behavior analysis, and workflow automation.

**Business Objectives**:
- Enable developers to create automated tests without coding
- Provide user behavior analytics and session replay capabilities  
- Reduce manual testing effort by 70%
- Support cross-browser compatibility testing
- Enable debugging and error reproduction

**Success Metrics**:
- Recording accuracy: 99% of DOM interactions captured correctly
- Replay fidelity: 95% successful replay rate across different browsers
- Performance impact: <5% overhead during recording
- Time to market: 6 months for MVP

### 2. Problem Statement

Current challenges in web application testing and user behavior analysis:

1. **Manual Testing Bottleneck**: Testing teams spend 60-80% of time on repetitive manual testing
2. **Bug Reproduction Difficulty**: Developers struggle to reproduce user-reported bugs without context
3. **Limited User Behavior Insights**: Analytics tools provide metrics but not actual user interaction flows
4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Manual testing across multiple browsers is time-consuming
5. **Regression Testing Gaps**: New features often break existing functionality due to inadequate regression testing

### 3. Target Users
