# DOM Interaction Recording and Replay System

## Overview
I need to build a system that records user interactions on a website and replays them automatically. The system consists of two main components:

## Component 1: Recording SDK/Extension
**Purpose:** Capture and store user interactions

**Requirements:**
- Record all user interactions with the DOM (clicks, typing, scrolling, form submissions, etc.)
- Track the DOM elements involved in each interaction (selectors, attributes, positions)
- Capture the sequence and timing of interactions
- Store the recorded interaction data in a database
- Reference: Similar to how bugbug.io tracks user interactions

**Key Data to Capture:**
- Element selectors (CSS selectors, XPath)
- Interaction type (click, input, scroll, hover, etc.)
- Interaction values (text entered, options selected, etc.)
- Timestamp and sequence order
- Page URL and context

## Component 2: Playback SDK
**Purpose:** Retrieve and replay recorded interactions on the live website

**Requirements:**
- Pull interaction data from the database
- Locate the corresponding DOM elements on the live site
- Execute the interactions in the correct sequence and timing
- Handle dynamic content and element changes
- Provide playback controls (start, pause, stop, replay)

## Technical Considerations
- Handle dynamic DOM changes and single-page applications (SPAs)
- Ensure robust element selection (fallback selectors if primary selector fails)
- Account for timing and asynchronous operations
- Manage state and session context during playback
